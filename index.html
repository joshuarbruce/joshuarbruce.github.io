		<p><b>People Scientist at Snap Inc.</b></p>
		<p>I am a computational sociologist who creatively uses data to understand organizations’ ecosystems, with a focus on the people and strategic partnerships that enable organizational success. I’ve worked on projects using both structured and unstructured data, ranging from historical HR personnel records to job description texts to geolocated government contracts. The goal in all the projects I have worked on is to understand and improve workplace experiences for employees and organizations' performance based on sound research methods.</p>
